    <span class="date">Apr 2012</span> - <span class="date">Present</span><br/>
    <p>As an architect as Huron, Mark developed tools aimed to modernize the proprietary development stack used to develop the organization's products. These tools replaced server side JavaScript APIs with the ability to develop application code in C#. Proprietary development tools were replaced with a Visual Studio extension which provided design surfaces for designing application data models, and generating C# classes to allow strongly typed, intellisense enabled, coding against the data model.</p>
    <p>The new C# development environment enabled the development of automated testing for applications that previously had no automated testing.</p>
